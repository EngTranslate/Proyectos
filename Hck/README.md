### Warning: Advanced!

The file [Translate.js](https://github.com/EngTranslate/Proyectos/blob/master/Hck/Translate.js) included in this folder is a script that can be used to modify a[ translation web app](https://translate.google.com.mx) to convert it into a text editor/translator which may prove useful if you wish to do your own translation. Currently this can be used by copy-pasting the JavaScript code into the browser console. Here's how to do that: 

1. Open your browser and press Ctrl+shift+I to open the developer's toolbox.

2. Select the 'Console' tab.

3. Click anywhere on the console and paste the code.

4. Press 'Enter'.



This will modify the appearence and functionality of the web app. You should see a noticable difference in the appearence. Now, to use it do the following:

1. Click on the 'Choose File' button to navigate to the file you wish to translate/review and select it.
2. You should see the first sentence appear in a box on the screen and the translation in another. If you like the translation you can 'KEEP' it but if you see something that needs changed you should edit it before doing so. \(**warning**: _some features not yet completed_\)
3. Once you have finished with one sentence you can click on the arrow button to advance. You should edit each entry in the list until the whole file is finished. If you need to go back you can do so as well.
4. When you are finished you should save the doccument.
