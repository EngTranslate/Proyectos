## How to Create your article from sections

#### Create a bare-bones version for translation

You may be inclined to start including all the text, tables, images and other content in a doccument, but wait!!! Don't do that yet. First you need to make a version for translation. 

The translation text needs to be free of images and other problematic content to work smoothly. Here are some things that you may want to ommit from the translation version of your doccument.

1. **Images**: The links to your images may be broken after translation and this could be frustrating to you and your coauthors.
2. **Tables**: Most tables do not need to be included. In addition, the table's formatting could cause conflicts with the translator producing garbage output.
3. **References**: Most references consist of names of people, places, books, articles, etc. which should not be translated. If you include this in your translation draft you will likely end up with useless output.



#### Get your article Translated/Reviewed

Now that you have your Translation draft you can either try to [translate it yourself ](https://github.com/EngTranslate/Proyectos/tree/master/Hck)or you can notify someone qualified to do so. This should result in a Final Draft. You can now add the tables, images, references, etc. to finish it up.
