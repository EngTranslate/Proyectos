## How to get started...

#### Set up your system

First of all you need to make sure you have your system set up for working with GitHub.

1. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v1/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your computer. Git is a system for managing files under complex circumstances. Don't worry, you will learn it very fast!
2. Set up your own [Github account](https://github.com).
3. Install the git [text editor GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com).

Now you should be ready to start writing an article.

#### Write the article

To make it easy to write and organise all the information, references, tables, doccuments and images that might go into your project a template has already been made for you. So, to begin...

1. [Create a New project](#). You can do this by forking the template project and giving it a new name.
2. You should now be able to just fill the data in for each section. If you need to add a new section you can; you don't have to stick to the template. You should be able to find general instructions in each section.
3. Once all the information is together you will need to [Compose the final draft](https://github.com/EngTranslate/Proyectos/blob/master/compose.md) from the sections.
